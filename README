LEOCHARRE::Strings - Combines string procedures I frequently use

SYNOPSIS
       use LEOCHARRE:Strings ':all';
   
       my $var = ' /path/to/file ';
   
       shomp $var; # remove whitespace leading and trailing
   
       my $shell_safe = sq($var); # escapes chars for shell
       pretty($var); # make pretty

SUBS
    Not imported by default.

  sq()
    String::ShellQuote::shell_quote. Arg is string, makes safe for shell
    use.

  pretty()
    String::Prettify::prettify()

  shomp()
    Arg is string variable. Takes out all leading and ending whitespace from
    string.

       my $var= ' this is ';

       shomp $var;

       # now $var is 'this is'

    Returns true if it found something, false if not. This alters your
    original variable, as chomp would. cannot take lists as args.

  is_blank()
    Arg is string. Returns true if it's defined, and has a non space char.
    Returns false if undefined or ony contains whitespace.

    Arg is string. Returns true if it's # comment line only, false
    otherwise.
